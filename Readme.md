Project contains a simple class for reading image data over a socket.

Class reads image data from a socket, parses each pixel, and then displays the 
full 640*480 BufferedImage.
Included in the project files is "cvcamerastream.py" a python implementation of 
a camera stream using opencv's camera libs.

To test:
Run project "CVCameraStream.class" and then run the included "cvcamerasteam.py" 
on a computer with an installation of opencv 2.4.5 or greater
